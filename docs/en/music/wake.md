# Wake

At break of day, in hope we rise
We speak Your Name, we lift our eyes
Tune our hearts into Your beat
Where we walk, there You'll be

With fire in our eyes, our lives alight
Your love untamed, it's blazing out
The streets will glow forever bright
Your glory's breaking through the night

You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay

By my side, in my life
Shining through me every day

You wake within me
Wake within me

You're in my heart forever
You within me

Forever, forever, forever in Your love
Forever, forever, forever, we know that
