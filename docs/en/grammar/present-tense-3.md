## 用法

主谓宾构成方式：have/has + 实义动词过去分词。一般分为以下四种情况:

1. 人称代词主格 + have/has + 不及物动词过去分词
2. 名词 + have/has + 不及物动词过去分词
3. 人称代词主格 + have/has + 及物动词过去分词 + 宾语
4. 名词 + have/has + 及物动词过去分词 + 宾语

变否定句，have/has 后面加 not。

主系表构成方式：have/has + been + 表语。一般分为以下四种情况:

2. 名词 + have/has + been + 表语（形容词）
3. 人称代词主格 + have/has + been + 表语（名词）
4. 名词 + have/has + been + 表语（名词）
