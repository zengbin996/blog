## where 在哪里，哪里

1. 做地点状语

where 做地点状语一般只能出现的主谓宾的句子，主系表不可以。

做地点状语，句型：“Where + 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语”。疑问词后面必须使用一般疑问句，所以 where 后面的主谓宾必须是一般疑问句的结构。

例句：

- Where do you learn English?（一般现在时态）
- Where do they work?
- Where do your friends sell clothes?
- Where does Nick teach English?（单三）
- Where does she bake sweet potatoes every day?
- Where does he run every morning?
- Where will she buy a house next year?（一般将来时态）
- Where will you business next month?
- Where will your aunt dance tonight?
- Where is she going to look for a job next month?(be going to)
- Where am I going to teach English in the future?
- Where are my friends going to swim tomorrow?
- Where is she drinking wine now?（现在进行时态）
- Where are they running now?
- Where is Nick baking sweet potatoes?
- Where has she gone to?（现在完成时态）
- Where has she bought a house?
- Where have they learned English for year?

2. 作表语

句型：“Where + be + 主语 + 状语？”，因为 where 本身是疑问词，所以必须放开头，然后，有因为疑问词后面必须是一般疑问句结构，所以 be 动词要移到主语前面，因此，where 作表语的句型，就变成了：“表语 + 系动词 + 主语 + 状语？”，这就是典型的倒装结构。作表语也又有时态要求。

例句：

- Where is your driver?（一般现在时态）
- Where is my money?
- Where are my fans?
- Where are his shoes?
- Where am I now?
- Where are you from?（做介词宾语）
- Where is she from?
- Where do you come from?
- Where did you put your book?（做宾补）

## what 什么

What 可以充当宾语、表语和主语的作用。

1. 作宾语，what 做宾语很复杂，因为宾语的情况很多，what 可以做普通及物动词的宾语，也可以做双宾动词的宾语，还可以做动词短语的宾语等等。

例句：

- What do you eat every day?（一般现在时态）
- What do they learn every day?
- What do my fans drink every night?
- What did you eat just now?（一般过去时态）
- What did they see last night?
- What did you read yesterday?
- What will you eat tomorrow?（一般将来时态）
- What will we do next week?
- What will she borrow tomorrow?
- What is she going to write?
- What are you doing?（现在进行时态）
- What is she cooking?
- What are they selling?
- What have you done?（现在完成时态）
- What has he eaten?
- What has she learned for ten years?

2. 做表语，what 做表语和 where 做表语差不多，句型：“what + be + 主语？”，但是做表语用的不多，并且基本上都用在一般现在时态里面，其他时态极少出现。主语大多数都是抽象名词。

例句：

- What is love?
- What is your name?
- What is your secret?
- What is your plan?

## why 为什么

why 主要充当原因状语，其他作用极少，主谓宾和主系表都可以用。

例句：

- Why do you learn English?(一般现在时态)
- Why does she buy clothes on taobao.com every month?
- Why do they work so hard?
- Why did you tell me this stroy just now?(一般过去时态)
- Why did you stay up so late last night?
- Why did she cry just now?
- Why will you leave the company next year?（一般将来时态）
- Why are you going to leave the company next year?
- Why will they go to Guangxi next year?
- Why is she singing so loudly?（现在进行时态）
- Why are they screaming?
- Why are they following the man?
- Why are you so sad?（主系表，一般现在时态）
- Why is she so rich?
- Why am I so poor?
- Why are you so angry?
- Why was she late just now?（一般过去时态）
- Why were you silent just now?
