| who    | 谁         |
| which  | 哪一个     |
| how    | 如何，怎样 |

## where 在哪里，哪里

1. 做地点状语

where 做地点状语一般只能出现的主谓宾的句子，主系表不可以。

做地点状语，句型：“Where + 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语”。疑问词后面必须使用一般疑问句，所以 where 后面的主谓宾必须是一般疑问句的结构。

例句：

- Where do you learn English?（一般现在时态）
- Where do they work?
- Where do your friends sell clothes?
- Where does Nick teach English?（单三）
- Where does she bake sweet potatoes every day?
- Where does he run every morning?
- Where will she buy a house next year?（一般将来时态）
- Where will you business next month?
- Where will your aunt dance tonight?
- Where is she going to look for a job next month?(be going to)
- Where am I going to teach English in the future?
- Where are my friends going to swim tomorrow?
- Where is she drinking wine now?（现在进行时态）
- Where are they running now?
- Where is Nick baking sweet potatoes?
- Where has she gone to?（现在完成时态）
- Where has she bought a house?
- Where have they learned English for year?

2. 作表语

句型：“Where + be + 主语 + 状语？”，因为 where 本身是疑问词，所以必须放开头，然后，有因为疑问词后面必须是一般疑问句结构，所以 be 动词要移到主语前面，因此，where 作表语的句型，就变成了：“表语 + 系动词 + 主语 + 状语？”，这就是典型的倒装结构。作表语也又有时态要求。

例句：

- Where is your driver?（一般现在时态）
- Where is my money?
- Where are my fans?
- Where are his shoes?
- Where am I now?
- Where are you from?（做介词宾语）
- Where is she from?
- Where do you come from?
- Where did you put your book?（做宾补）

## what 什么

What 可以充当宾语、表语和主语的作用。

1. 作宾语，what 做宾语很复杂，因为宾语的情况很多，what 可以做普通及物动词的宾语，也可以做双宾动词的宾语，还可以做动词短语的宾语等等。

例句：

- What do you eat every day?（一般现在时态）
- What do they learn every day?
- What do my fans drink every night?
- What did you eat just now?（一般过去时态）
- What did they see last night?
- What did you read yesterday?
- What will you eat tomorrow?（一般将来时态）
- What will we do next week?
- What will she borrow tomorrow?
- What is she going to write?
- What are you doing?（现在进行时态）
- What is she cooking?
- What are they selling?
- What have you done?（现在完成时态）
- What has he eaten?
- What has she learned for ten years?

2. 做表语，what 做表语和 where 做表语差不多，句型：“what + be + 主语？”，但是做表语用的不多，并且基本上都用在一般现在时态里面，其他时态极少出现。主语大多数都是抽象名词。

例句：

- What is love?
- What is your name?
- What is your secret?
- What is your plan?

## why 为什么

why 主要充当原因状语，其他作用极少，主谓宾和主系表都可以用。

例句：

- Why do you learn English?(一般现在时态)
- Why does she buy clothes on taobao.com every month?
- Why do they work so hard?
- Why did you tell me this stroy just now?(一般过去时态)
- Why did you stay up so late last night?
- Why did she cry just now?
- Why will you leave the company next year?（一般将来时态）
- Why are you going to leave the company next year?
- Why will they go to Guangxi next year?
- Why is she singing so loudly?（现在进行时态）
- Why are they screaming?
- Why are they following the man?
- Why are you so sad?（主系表，一般现在时态）
- Why is she so rich?
- Why am I so poor?
- Why are you so angry?
- Why was she late just now?（一般过去时态）
- Why were you silent just now?

## whose 谁的

whose 通常做前置定语，修饰名词，也就是：“whose + 名词”。可以用作宾语、表语和主语。

### 作宾语

1. 一般现在时态

- Whose book do you like?
- Whose songs does she listen to every day?

2. 一般过去时态

- Whose car did he steal last night?
- Whose book did you take just now?

3. 一般将来时态

- Whose daughter will he marry next year?
- Whose car will Jeff drive after class?
- Whose money am I going to borrow tomorrow?

4. 现在进行时态

- Whose food are you tasting?
- Whose wine is she drinking?

5. 现在完成时态

- Whose purse have you taken?
- Whose cellphone has she borrowed?
- Whose car have they driven for an hour?

### 作表语

- Whose is this car?
- Whose is the book?
- Whose are the books?

## When 什么时候

When 主要充当时间状语和表语

### 做时间状语

1. 一般现在时态

- When do you get up every morning?
- When does she do homework?
- When do they have dinner?

2.  一般过去时态

- When did you buy a house in Beijing?
- When did she leave?
- When did they clean the office?

3. 一般将来时态

- When will she go?

4. 主系表

- When will she be a doctor?
- When are you going to be free?

### 做表语

- When is your birthday?
- When is next meeting?
- When is her wedding?

## whom 谁

歧视，whom 作为疑问词已经差不多淘汰了，现代英语已经很少用了，基本都用 who。当然，whom 做定语从句的连接词还是很常见的。

首先，因为 whom 是 who 的宾格，所以 whom 就是充当宾语。

### 作宾语

- Whom do you love?
- Whom does she love?
- Whom did you find just now?
- Whom will you fire tomorrow?
- Whom are they discussing?
- Whom has he invited?

## which 哪一个

which 和 whose 的用法类似，都是做定语，修饰名词。只不过 whose 修饰可数名词单复数或不可数名词都可以。which 一般情况下只能修饰可数名词单数，特殊情况除外。

### 做宾语

句型结构：which + 名词单数 + 助动词 + 主语 + 及物动词 + (状语)

- Which girl do you like?
- Which book does she like?
- Which man is Pandora going to marry?
- Which house will you buy?
- Which shirt did you pick just now?
- Which movie have you watched?
- Which lesson are you listening to?

## how 如何，怎么样

how 可以充当表语和方式状语。

### 做表语

how 做表语，一般用于一般现在时态和一般过去时态，其他一般不用。how 做表语的句型也叫万用句型，因为能做主语并且符合逻辑的词语非常多，可以是表语人的词语，可以是表示物的词语，甚至可以是抽象概念的词语也可以。

- How are you?
- How is your mother?
- How are your kinds?
- How is your business?
- How is your trip?
- How was your weekend?
- How have you been?

### 做方式状语

- How do you learn English?
- How does she do business?
- How did he open th door last night?
- How did they die last year?
- How will they build the house?
- How are you going to cook the duck?

### how + 形容词/副词

1. How long 多久/多长时间

how long 做时间状语，主要用于现在完成时态第一种用法，必须使用延续性都给你吃，句型如下：

- How long have you been a teacher?
- How long have you learned English?
- How long has Nick taught English?

- How long is your hair?
- How long is the river?

2. how far 多远

how far 主要做表语，偶尔可以做状语。句型如下：

- How far is your home?
- How far is your school?

有时候，这个句型还可以加一个地点状语，由“from + 地点”构成的介词短语做地点状语，表示“离···有多远”。

- How far is your hometown form here?
- How far is Beijing from Guangxi?
- How far is your home from your school?

3. how much/how many 多少

how much 可以做表语，表示“多少钱”，问商品的价格，句型如下：

- How much is your computer?

how much 可以做定语，修饰不可数名词，注意，一定不能修饰可数名词，然后“how much + 不可数名词” = 新的复合疑问词，这个复合疑问词可以做宾语和主语。

- How much money do you have?
- How much beer did you drink last night?
- How much wine will they produce next month?

做宾语

- How many books did you buy last year?
- How many lovers do you have?
- How many fans will I have at the end or this year?

4. how often 多久一次

“how often”主要做状语，因为表示频率，喜欢用在一般现在时态里面，句型如下：

- How often do you go home?
- How often do they run in the park?
- How often does she have dinner at home?

## 疑问词作主语

英语有些疑问词可以充当主语，这个时候，是不需要倒装的，也就是不需要用一般疑问句的构成方式，因为本来主语就是放在开头，这个和之前的不一样。

句型：

1. 疑问词 + 谓语 + 宾语？
2. 疑问词 + be + 表语？

疑问词作主语构成的特殊疑问句跟肯定句的构成方式一样的。不过，不是每一个疑问词都可以充当主语，下面是能作主语的疑问词：

- Which
- Whose
- How many/much
- Who/What
