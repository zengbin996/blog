It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew all the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here
Talking to you about another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

How could we not take about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

Firstï¼Œ you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong
And what's small turned to friendship, a friendship turned to a bound
And that bond'll never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
