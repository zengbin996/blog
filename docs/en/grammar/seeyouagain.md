It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew all the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here
Talking to you about another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

How could we not take about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
