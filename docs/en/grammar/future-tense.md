# 一般将来时态

英语用一般将来时态表示将来发生的动作或者状态，也可以认为它就是用来谈论将来计划的，因为动作和状态都还没发生，所以只是计划而已。

一般将来时态的构成方式很简单，都是“将来助动词 + 动词原型”，但是“将来助动词”有好多个，所以构成方式也有几种！

## 主语 + will + be + 表语 + 将来时间状语

1. 人称代词主格 + will + be + 形容词 + 将来时间状语

- I will be busy tomorrow.
- You will be tried tonight.
- She will be rich in the future.
- He will be capable next year.
- They will be famous in the future.

3. after + 具体的时间点：after 5:00，after school 等

## be going to

be going to 可以代替住助动词 will。它有三种格式，分别是 is going to / are going to / am going to, 用的时候需要按照主语的不同格式进行变化。

主语是单数概念的词语，都用“is going to”，主语是复数概念或者 you ， 都用 “are going to”， 主语是 I 才能用 “am going to”。
